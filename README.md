**What this does:**

1. ✅ **Auto-caches everything** - Any successful GET request is automatically cached
2. ✅ **Zero configuration** - No need to specify URLs, cache names, or messages
3. ✅ **Works everywhere** - Every endpoint becomes offline-capable automatically
4. ✅ **Smart fallbacks** - Serves cached content when offline, with sensible defaults
5. ✅ **Clean API** - Just `makeOffline(html)` and add the `/sw.js` endpoint

The service worker uses a "cache everything" strategy - it intercepts all requests, tries to fetch from network first, and if successful, automatically caches the response. When offline, it serves from cache. No configuration needed!
